/*
Creating a unique struct threadArgs instance for each thread ensures that each thread has its own independent copy of the data it needs.
Avoiding Data Race Conditions: If all threads shared a single threadArgs struct, they would each overwrite the values of id, numThreads, and squaredId.
Passing Data Between Threads: Each thread needs to know its unique id and store its calculated squaredId independently.
Dynamic Allocation for Flexibility: When you dynamically allocate an array of threadArgs, itâ€™s easy to create a variable number of threads
